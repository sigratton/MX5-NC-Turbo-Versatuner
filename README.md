# MX5-NC-Turbo-Versatuner
Process of tuning my MX5 NC with versatuner.

## Overview

This is the process that I followed to turbo my MX5 NC.  This is all about the tuning.  There are heaps of youtube videos on how to install the hardware, but very little on how to tune the factory ECU.

For this guide I will be using VersaTuner.  I selected VersaTuner because it is a relative cost effective option in comparison to something like EcuTek.  

## The hardware

These are the main hardware components I am using.  NOTE - if you are following this guide DO NOT install everything.

- Kracken exhaust manifold and downpipe
- pulsar 2860 turbo
- flowforce 640cc injectors
- GM 3 bar map sensor
- performance mrp MAF tube with air straighter
- PWR intercooler

## The approach

Whether it be hardware or tuning in VersaTuner, the main principal is to change one thing at a time.  Changing multiple hardware components and trying to tune for them will result in frustration and probably a very poor tune - YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

At each step we want to get the car back to a good ecu calibration/tune, before we move to the next step.  As you become aware of, the ECU;s tables and setting all interact with one another, so moving to the next step without spending the time to get a solid calibration/tune will basically introduce errors that you may struggle to correct later.

- Ensure you have a solid base tune
- MAP sensor change and calibration
- Injector change and calibration
- MAP tube and calibration
- Scaling for forced induction
- Final tune
